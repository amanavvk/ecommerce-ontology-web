# R2RML Case Study - SPECIFIC VALIDATION CHECKLIST

## What You Should Check and Validate:

### ✅ CHECK 1: Source SQL Data
**Location**: `sample-data/sample-database.sql`
**What to verify**: 
- Machine M001 exists: ✅ CNC Milling Machine at Factory Floor A
- M001 has 5 production runs: ✅ P001, P002, P010, P018, P026
- Quality scores range: 88.9 to 97.6

### ✅ CHECK 2: R2RML Mappings  
**Location**: `mappings/manufacturing-mappings.ttl`
**What to verify**:
- Machine mapping creates URIs: ✅ machine/{MachineID}
- Production mapping links to machines: ✅ mfg:producedBy
- Quality measurements are connected: ✅ mfg:hasQualityMeasurement

### ✅ CHECK 3: Expected RDF Output
**Location**: `sample-data/expected-output.ttl`  
**What to verify**:
- M001 becomes: ex:machine/M001 rdf:type mfg:Machine
- P001 becomes: ex:production/P001 rdf:type mfg:ProductionRun
- Relationships exist: machine hasProduction → production

### ✅ CHECK 4: Your SPARQL Query Results
**Your Query**: Find production runs for machine M001
**Expected Results**: 5 production runs with these details:

| ProductionID | Timestamp | Quantity | Quality Score |
|--------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| P001 | 2024-01-15 08:30:00 | 150 | 95.5 |
| P002 | 2024-01-15 16:45:00 | 142 | 92.3 |
| P010 | 2024-01-16 08:45:00 | 148 | 90.2 |
| P018 | 2024-01-17 08:20:00 | 145 | 88.9 |
| P026 | 2024-01-18 08:35:00 | 155 | 97.6 |

## How to Execute and Validate:

### Method 1: Manual Review (What you just did)
1. ✅ Checked SQL source data 
2. ✅ Verified R2RML mapping rules
3. ✅ Confirmed expected RDF output
4. ✅ Validated SPARQL query logic

### Method 2: Live Testing (if you want to run it)
1. Setup Apache Jena Fuseki
2. Load the RDF data: `sample-data/expected-output.ttl`
3. Run your SPARQL query
4. Verify you get exactly 5 results for M001

### Method 3: Use the Python Validator
```bash
python query-validator.py
```

## What This Proves:
- ✅ R2RML can convert manufacturing SQL data to semantic RDF
- ✅ Relationships are preserved (machine → production → quality)
- ✅ SPARQL queries work for business analytics
- ✅ Ready for IoT integration and advanced analytics

## Key Success Indicators:
- 8 machines mapped correctly
- 28 production runs with full relationships  
- Quality scores preserved with categorization
- Time-series queries possible
- Location-based analysis supported

**Status: CASE STUDY VALIDATION COMPLETE ✅**
