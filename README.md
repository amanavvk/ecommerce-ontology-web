# E-Commerce Ontology Web Application

This project is a comprehensive E-Commerce Ontology Web Application built using Next.js 15.5.0 with TypeScript. It provides a modern, professional platform for visualizing and interacting with OWL ontologies, executing SPARQL queries, and validating e-commerce data with a beautiful tabular interface.

## üöÄ Live Demo

**Deployed on Vercel:** [https://sementicwebcasestudies-n758cm6x5-aman2clouds-projects.vercel.app](https://sementicwebcasestudies-n758cm6x5-aman2clouds-projects.vercel.app)

## üéØ What We Built

This application demonstrates a complete semantic web solution with:

### ‚ú® **Professional UI/UX**
- Modern, branded e-commerce validation interface with clean table layouts
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Professional navigation and component structure
- Error-free TypeScript implementation

### üîç **SPARQL Query Interface**
- Interactive SPARQL query editor with syntax highlighting
- Pre-built queries for e-commerce analytics:
  - Product listings with categories and prices
  - User management and order tracking
  - Category hierarchy visualization
  - Order analytics and customer insights
- Real-time query execution with formatted results

### üìä **Data Validation System**
- Comprehensive e-commerce data validation in clean table format
- Support for products, users, orders, and categories
- Visual validation results with professional styling

### üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15.5.0 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Data Source:** TTL (Turtle) files containing real e-commerce data
- **Deployment Strategy:** 
  - **Development:** Apache Jena Fuseki for local SPARQL endpoint
  - **Production:** Direct TTL file integration for Vercel deployment
- **Smart Fallback:** Automatic switching between live SPARQL endpoint and mock data based on environment

## üìã **Deployment Strategy**

We implemented a hybrid approach for maximum compatibility:

1. **Local Development:** Uses Apache Jena Fuseki SPARQL endpoint for real-time queries
2. **Production (Vercel):** Uses curated mock data that exactly matches the TTL file structure from `public/data2/`
3. **Seamless Transition:** The application automatically detects the environment and provides consistent query results

    - **queries/**: Handles SPARQL query execution and display.
    - **validation/**: Manages data validation.
    - **api/**: Contains API routes for SPARQL queries, validation, and file uploads.
  - **components/**: Reusable UI components.
  - **lib/**: Utility functions and libraries for SPARQL and ontology handling.
  - **types/**: TypeScript types and interfaces.

- **public/**: Contains static files including ontologies, SPARQL queries, and sample data.
